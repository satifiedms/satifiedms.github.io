    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
      </p>
        Database security refers to the processes, tools, policies, and techniques used to protect a database from unauthorized access, misuse, corruption, loss, or damage.
        It ensures that data stored in a database remains confidential, accurate, and available to authorized users only. 
        In simple terms, database security protects data from threats and ensures it remains safe, correct, and accessible when
        needed.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Importance of Database Security</b></p>
      </p><b>i. Protection of Sensitive Information - </b>Databases often store personal data, financial records, health information, and business secrets. Security helps prevent theft or exposure.</p>
      <p><b>ii. Preventing Unauthorized Access - </b> Strong security measures ensure only the right people can view or modify information.</p>
      <p><b>iii. Maintaining Data Integrity - </b>Security protects data from being altered, deleted, or corrupted by accident or malicious attacks.</p>
      <p><b>iv. Ensuring Business Continuity - </b>Organizations rely on databases to operate. Security ensures the database remains available, even during failures.</p>
      <p><b>v. Compliance with Laws and Regulations - </b>Many countries and industries have data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). Database security ensures compliance.</p>
      <p><b>vi. Preventing Financial Loss and Reputation Damage - </b>Data breaches can cause loss of money, customer trust, and brand reputation.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Access Control in Database Security</b></p>
      <p>Access control refers to the rules and mechanisms that determine who can access the database and what actions they are
        allowed to perform.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Types of Access Control:</b></p>
      <p><b>i. Discretionary Access Control (DAC) - </b>The owner of the data decides who gets access. Example: A manager granting access to certain staff.</p>
      <p><b>ii. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) - </b>Access is based on predefined security levels (e.g., Top Secret, Confidential). Users must have the appropriate clearance.</p>
      <p><b>iii. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - </b>Access is based on user roles within an organization.</p>
      <p><b>Example:</b></p>
      <p>i. A cashier can enter sales data</p>
      <p>ii. A supervisor can update sales records</p>
      <p>iii. An admin can manage all users</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Encryption</b></p>
      <p>Encryption is the process of converting data into a coded form so that it cannot be understood by unauthorized users.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>Types of Encryption in Databases:</b></p>
      <p><b>i. Data-at-Rest Encryption - </b>Secures stored data on disks or backup files.</p>
      <p><b>ii. Data-in-Transit Encryption - </b>Protects data moving between systems, such as between a web app and a database server.</p>
      <p><b>iii. Column-level or Field-level Encryption - </b>Specific sensitive data such as passwords, credit card numbers, or medical data are encrypted.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Importance of Encryption</b></p>
      <p>i. Prevents data theft even when hackers break into the server</p>
      <p>ii. Protects sensitive information</p>
      <p>iii. Helps organizations meet compliance requirements</p>
      <p>iv. Ensures data privacy and confidentiality</p>

      <p><b>Data Integrity</b></p>
      <p>Integrity refers to the correctness, accuracy, and consistency of data in a database.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Ways to Maintain Data Integrity:</b></p>
      <p>i. Validation rules (e.g., age cannot be negative)</p>
      <p>ii. Constraints (primary key, foreign key, unique, check constraints)</p>
      <p>iii. Backups and transaction logs</p>
      <p>iv. Avoiding duplicate records</p>
      <p>v. Preventing unauthorized changes</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Types of Integrity:</b></p>
      <p><b>Entity Integrity: </b>Each record must have a unique primary key</p>
      <p><b>Referential Integrity: </b>Relationship between tables must remain consistent</p>
      <p><b>Domain Integrity: </b>Data values must be valid according to defined rules</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Data Availability</b></p>
      <p>Availability ensures that authorized users can access the database whenever needed.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>How Availability is Ensured:</b></p>
      <p>i. Regular backups</p>
      <p>ii. Redundant systems and failover servers</p>
      <p>iii. Reliable power supply and network connections</p>
      <p>iv. Database performance tuning</p>
      <p>v. Protection against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks</p>
      <p>vi. Disaster recovery plans</p>
      <p>High availability ensures continuous access, especially for systems that run 24/7 (banks, hospitals, airlines, etc.).</p>
      <br>
      
      <p><b>Role of the Database Administrator (DBA) in Security</b></p>
      <p>The Database Administrator plays a central role in maintaining database security.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Key Responsibilities of the DBA:</b></p>
      <p><b>i. User Management</b></p>
      <p>- Creating and deleting user accounts</p>
      <p>- Assigning roles and privileges</p>
      <p>- Enforcing strong authentication methods</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>ii. Implementing Access Control Policies</b></p>
      <p>Ensuring that users only access the data they are authorized to use.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>iii. Monitoring and Auditing Database Activities</b></p>
      <p>Tracking user actions through logs to detect suspicious activities early.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>iv. Backup and Recovery Management</b></p>
      <p>Making regular backups and designing disaster recovery strategies.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>v. Applying Security Patches and Updates</b></p>
      <p>Keeping the database software updated to protect against vulnerabilities.</p>
      <br>
      
      <p><b>vi. Designing and Enforcing Security Policies</b></p>
      <p>Setting rules for password strength, data access, and system usage.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Summary</b></p>
      <p>Database security ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
        It involves access control, encryption, integrity checks, and availability measures.

    </div>
  
    <div class="content">
      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
      <p>In database systems, crash recovery refers to the process of restoring the database to a consistent state after a
        failure.
        Databases are expected to provide reliability and durability, ensuring that once a transaction is committed, its effects
        are permanent — even in the event of system crashes, power failures, or software errors. 
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>Failures can occur due to:</p>
      <p>i. System crashes (hardware/software failure)</p>
      <p>ii. Transaction failures</p>
      <p>iii. Media failures (disk corruption)</p>
      <p>iv. Power outages</p>
      <p>To ensure data durability, database systems use recovery mechanisms that rely heavily on logs and checkpointing.</p>
      <br>
      
      <p><b>Objectives of Crash Recovery</b></p>
      <p><b>i. Preserve atomicity – </b> either all actions of a transaction are completed or none are.</p>
      <p><b>ii. Maintain consistency – </b>the database remains in a valid state before and after recovery.</p>
      <p><b>iii. Ensure durability – </b>committed transactions must survive crashes.</p>
      <p><b>iv. Minimize downtime – </b> restore the database quickly to operational state.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Types of Failures in Databases</b></p>
      <br>

      <p>1. Transaction Failure</p>
      <p>- Occurs when a transaction cannot complete successfully (e.g., logical errors, deadlocks).</p>
      <p>- Requires rollback of changes made by that transaction.</p>
  
      <p>2. System Failure</p>
      <p>- System crash causes all active transactions to be lost from memory</p>

      <p>3. Media Failure</p>
      <p>- Permanent loss or corruption of data (e.g., disk crash), requiring data restoration from backups.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>ARIES (Algorithm for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics)</b></p>
      <p>ARIES is one of the most widely used and advanced recovery algorithms, adopted by major database systems such as IBM
        DB2, SQL Server, and Oracle.
      </p>
      <p>It is based on three main principles:</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>i. Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) - </b>All changes must be logged before being written to disk.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>ii. Repeating History During Redo - </b>Redo all actions from the log to reconstruct the state of the database before failure.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>iii. Logging Changes During Undo - </b>While undoing, ARIES logs compensation records to ensure that the undo actions can also be recovered if another crash
      happens during recovery.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Importance of Crash Recovery</b></p>
      <p><b>i. Data durability — </b>committed data is never lost.</p>
      <p><b>ii. System reliability - </b>database can recover automatically after failure.</p>
      <p><b>iii. Business continuity - </b>minimizes downtime and operational impact.</p>
      <p><b>iv. Data integrity - </b>prevents inconsistent or partial updates.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>
      <p>Crash recovery is an essential component of modern database systems, ensuring atomicity, consistency, and durability.</p>
      <p>Algorithms like ARIES make this process efficient, reliable, and recoverable even from repeated failures.
      By maintaining proper logs, checkpoints, and recovery data structures, database systems can restore operations quickly
      and preserve the integrity of stored data.</p>
