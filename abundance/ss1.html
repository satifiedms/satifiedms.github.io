      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
      </p>
        The Earth is one of the eight planets that orbit the Sun in our Solar System. It is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet that supports life due to the presence of water, a suitable atmosphere, and a moderate temperature range.
        The Earth, together with other celestial bodies like the Moon, the Sun, and the stars, forms part of the universe. Its unique composition — land, water, and air — makes it habitable.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Shape of the Earth</b></p>
      <p>
        The Earth is not a perfect sphere. It is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator due to its rotation.
        This shape is called an oblate spheroid or geoid.
      </p>
      <p><b>Features of the Earth’s Shape:</b></p>
      <p><b>i. Flattened poles:</b> The polar diameter is shorter than the equatorial diameter.</p>
      <p><b>ii. Bulging equator: </b>The equatorial region extends outward due to centrifugal force.</p>
      <p><b>iii. Curved surface: </b> The Earth’s horizon appears curved, and objects disappear bottom-first when viewed from a distance.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Proofs of the Earth’s Sphericity</b></p>
      <p><b>i. Photographs from Space - </b>Satellite and space images clearly show that the Earth is round, confirming its spherical nature. </p>
      <p><b>ii. Horizon Appearance - </b>When a ship sails away from the shore, it gradually disappears from bottom to top, indicating that the surface of the Earth is curved. </p>
      <p><b>iii. Circular Shadow on the Moon - </b>During a lunar eclipse, the Earth casts a round shadow on the Moon, showing that the Earth must be spherical.</p>
      <p><b>iv. Variation in Time and Sunrise - </b>Different places on Earth experience sunrise and sunset at different times. This variation results from the Earth’s curved surface.</p>
      <p><b>v. Change in the Position of Stars - </b>As a person moves north or south, the altitude of stars changes gradually. Certain stars disappear from view at different latitudes — a phenomenon possible only on a spherical surface.</p>
      <p><b>vi. Circumnavigation - </b>Travelers and satellites can move around the Earth and return to their starting points, showing that the planet is round.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Movements of the Earth</b></p>
      <p>The Earth performs several movements in space, but the two main ones are Rotation and Revolution</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>1.  Rotation of the Earth - </b>Rotation is the spinning of the Earth on its axis from west to east.
        It takes approximately 24 hours (23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds) for one complete rotation.
      </p>
      <p><b>Effects of the Earth’s Rotation</b></p>
      <p><b>i. Day and Night – </b>The side of the Earth facing the Sun experiences day whilw the opposite side experiences night.</p>
      <p><b>ii. Apparent Sunrise and Sunset - </b>The Sun appears to rise in the east and set in the west due to Earth’s rotation.</p>
      <p><b>iii. Time Difference - </b>The Earth rotates 360° in 24 hours; hence, 1 hour = 15° of longitude.</p>
      <p><b>iv. Flattening at the Poles and Bulging at the Equator</b></p>
      <br>

      <p><b>2. Revolution of the Earth -</b></p>
      <p>Revolution is the movement of the Earth around the Sun in its elliptical orbit. It takes 365¼ days (one year) for the Earth to complete one revolution.
        Every four years, the extra ¼ day adds up to make a leap year of 366 days. The Earth revolves from west to east — the same direction as its rotation.
      </p>
      <p><b>Effects of Revolution</b></p>
      <p><b>i. Change in Seasons – </b>Due to the tilt of the axis and revolution, the Earth experiences summer, autumn, winter, and spring.</p>
      <p><b>ii. Variation in Day and Night Length – </b>Day length changes throughout the year depending on the tilt and position of the Earth in its orbit.</p>
      <p><b>iii. Difference in Solar Intensity – </b>The Sun’s rays are more direct in some regions and seasons, causing temperature differences.</p>
      <p><b>iv. Apparent Movement of the Sun – </b>The Sun appears to move north and south of the equator throughout the year (between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn).</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Comparison between Rotation and Revolution</b></p>
