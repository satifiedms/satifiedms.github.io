      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
      <p>The Earth is made up of several concentric layers with different compositions, temperatures, and physical properties.
      These layers are broadly divided into two major zones:</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>1. The Outer Zone - </b>consisting of layers we can see or interact with directly.</p>
      <p><b>2. The Interior Zone - </b>made up of deeper layers beneath the surface, studied using scientific tools such as seismic waves.</p>
      <p>Understanding these zones helps explain natural phenomena like earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and plate
      tectonics.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>The Outer Zone of the Earth</b></p>
      <p>The Outer Zone refers to the Earth’s external layers that form the immediate environment for life. These layers include:</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>1. The Atmosphere - </b>The atmosphere is the layer of gases surrounding the Earth. It is composed of 78% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen, and 1% other gases (CO₂, argon, helium, water vapour).
      The layers of the Atmosphere (from lowest to highest):</p>

      <p><b>i. Troposphere - </b>Weather occurs here; contains most atmospheric gases.</p>
      <p><b>ii. Stratosphere - </b>Contains the ozone layer which protects Earth from ultraviolet radiation.</p>
      <p><b>iii. Mesosphere - </b>Meteors burn up here.</p>
      <p><b>iv. Thermosphere - </b>Temperature rises sharply; contains the ionosphere.</p>
      <p><b>v. Exosphere - </b>Outermost layer merging into space.</p>

      <p><b>2. The Hydrosphere - </b>This includes all the water bodies on Earth: Oceans, rivers, seas, lakes etc.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>3. The Lithosphere - </b>The outermost solid layer of the Earth. It includes:</p>
      <p>i. Crust (continental and oceanic)</p>
      <p>ii. Upper part of the mantle (together forming tectonic plates)</p>
      <p>The lithosphere is broken into tectonic plates whose movements cause earthquakes, mountains, and volcanoes.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>4. The Biosphere - </b>The zone where life exists. It overlaps parts of the Lithosphere, Atmosphere and Hydrosphere.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>The Interior Zone of the Earth</b></p>
      <p>Also called the internal structure, this zone includes all layers beneath the crust. Knowledge of these layers comes
        from: Seismic wave studies, Drilling records, Volcanic materials and Laboratory simulations. The interior is divided into three main layers.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p><b>1. The Crust</b></p>
      <p>Although part of the lithosphere (outer zone), the crust is technically the uppermost layer of the interior zone.</p>

      <p><b>Characteristics:</b></p>
      <p>i. Thin, brittle, and cool compared to deeper layers.</p>
      <p>ii. Made of rocks such as granite (continental crust) and basalt (oceanic crust).</p>
      <p>iii. Temperature ranges from 0°C to 700°C.</p>
      <p>It is the foundation for continents and ocean basins.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>2. The Mantle</b></p>
      <p>The mantle lies below the crust and extends to about 2,900 km depth. It includes the Upper Mantle (including the asthenosphere) and Upper Mantle (including the asthenosphere).</p>
      <p><b>Characteristics:</b></p>
      <p>i. Composed of semi-solid rock rich in magnesium and iron.</p>
      <p>ii. Temperatures range from 1,000°C to 3,700°C.</p>
      <p>iii. The asthenosphere is partially molten and allows tectonic plates to move.</p>
      <p>iv. Convection currents within the mantle drive plate tectonics.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>3. The Core</b></p>
      <p>It is the deepest layer of the Earth's interior. It is divided into the <b>Outer Core</b> and <b>Inner Core</b>:</p>
