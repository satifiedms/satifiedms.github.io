        Examples are Summit, Fugaku, and Frontier.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p><b>4. Classification Based on Data Processing Type</b></p>
      <p><b>a. Analog Computers</b></p>
      <p>They process continuous data such as temperature, pressure, or speed and use physical quantities instead of discrete numbers. 
        Examples: Thermometers, analog voltmeters, and flight simulators.
      </p>
      <br>
      
      <p><b>b. Digital Computers</b></p>
      <p>They process discrete data (numbers, letters, symbols) using binary digits (0 and 1). Most modern computers fall into this category.
        They can be used for business calculations, education, entertainment purposes. Examples: PCs, calculators, smartphones.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p><b>c. Hybrid Computers</b></p>
      <p>They combine the features of both analog and digital computers. They convert analog signals into digital form for processing. 
        Examples: Hospital monitoring systems, scientific laboratories, and air traffic control systems.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p><b>5. Classification Based on Functionality</b></p>
      <p><b>a. Servers:</b></p>
      <p>They provide data and services to other computers over a network. Examples: Web servers, file servers, database servers.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>b. Workstations: </b></p>
      <p>These are high-performance computers used by professionals for design, animation, and software development.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>c. Embedded Systems</b></p>
      <p>These are small computers built into larger machines to control their functions. Examples: Smart TVs, microwaves, and automobiles.</p>
