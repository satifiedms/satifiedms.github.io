      <p><b>2. Classification Based on Purpose</b></p>
      </p><b>a. General-Purpose Computers:</b></p>
      <p>These computers are designed to perform a wide variety of tasks. They can process different kinds of data and run multiple types of programs like 
        gaming apps, word processing, internet browsing etc. Examples are Personal computers (PCs), Laptops and Workstations. 
      </p>
      <br>

      <p><b>b. Special-Purpose Computers:</b></p>
      <p>These are built to perform specific tasks or a single function. They are faster and more efficient at their designated job.
        Examples include ATM machines, Washing machine control units, Traffic light controller etc.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p><b>3. Classification Based on Size</b></p>
      <p><b>a. Microcomputers</b></p>
      <p>These are the smallest and most commonly used type of computers, designed for individual users. They are affordable,
        compact and easy to use. Examples include Desktops, Laptops, Tablets and Smartphones. 
      </p>
      <br>

      <p><b>b. Minicomputers</b></p>
      <p>These are medium-sized computers used by small to medium-sized organizations. They support multiple users simultaneously.
        They are used for data management, accounting and departmental process. Examples are DEC PDP series, IBM AS/400.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p><b>c. Mainframe Computers</b></p>
      <p>These are large and powerful systems used by large organizations. They are capable of handling hundreds or thousands of users at once.
        They are used in Banking, airline reservations, and census data processing. Eg IBM zSeries, UNIVAC 1100.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p><b>d. Supercomputers</b></p>
      <p>They are the fastest and most powerful type of computer. They are used for highly complex calculations e.g Weather forecasting, nuclear research, scientific simulations, and artificial intelligence. 
        Examples are Summit, Fugaku, and Frontier.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p><b>4. Classification Based on Data Processing Type</b></p>
      <p><b>a. Analog Computers</b></p>
      <p>They process continuous data such as temperature, pressure, or speed and use physical quantities instead of discrete numbers. 
        Examples: Thermometers, analog voltmeters, and flight simulators.
      </p>
      <br>
      
      <p><b>b. Digital Computers</b></p>
      <p>They process discrete data (numbers, letters, symbols) using binary digits (0 and 1). Most modern computers fall into this category.
        They can be used for business calculations, education, entertainment purposes. Examples: PCs, calculators, smartphones.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p><b>c. Hybrid Computers</b></p>
      <p>They combine the features of both analog and digital computers. They convert analog signals into digital form for processing. 
        Examples: Hospital monitoring systems, scientific laboratories, and air traffic control systems.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p><b>5. Classification Based on Functionality</b></p>
      <p><b>a. Servers:</b></p>
      <p>They provide data and services to other computers over a network. Examples: Web servers, file servers, database servers.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>b. Workstations: </b></p>
      <p>These are high-performance computers used by professionals for design, animation, and software development.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>c. Embedded Systems</b></p>
      <p>These are small computers built into larger machines to control their functions. Examples: Smart TVs, microwaves, and automobiles.</p>
      <br>

      <p>These is all we have under classification of computers. Meanwhile, the note on ICT Application in everyday life is being prepared at the moment,
        and it shall be included before saturday evening. So, if you are seeing this, ensure to check back in the evening for the not on Application of ICT. 
        Thank you.
