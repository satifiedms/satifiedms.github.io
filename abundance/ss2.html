    <div class="content">
      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
      </p>The term denudation comes from the Latin word denudare, meaning “to strip off.”
        In geography and geomorphology, denudation refers to the processes that wear away or remove the Earth’s surface
        materials — such as soil, rock, and other surface deposits — to reduce the elevation and relief of the land.
      </p>
      <p>In simpler terms, denudation is the gradual lowering and leveling of the Earth’s surface through the combined actions of
        weathering, erosion, transportation, and deposition. While denudation can cause soil loss and landscape degradation, it is also a vital process for the formation of soils,
        plains, and landforms that sustain life on Earth.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p><b>Major Processes of Denudation</b></p>
      </p>
        Denudation involves several interrelated natural processes that work together over long periods to modify the Earth's surface. These include:
      </p>
      
      <br>
      <p><b>1. Weathering</b></p>
      <p>Weathering is the disintegration and decomposition of rocks in situ (in their original position), 
        mainly due to atmospheric elements such as temperature changes, water, and biological activity.
      </p>

      <p><b>Types of Weathering</b></p>
      <p><b>i. Physical (Mechanical) Weathering: </b>Breakdown of rocks without chemical alteration (e.g., frost action, thermal expansion, pressure release).</p>
      <p><b>ii. Chemical Weathering: </b>Decomposition of rocks due to chemical reactions, such as oxidation, carbonation, hydration, and hydrolysis.</p>
      <p><b>iii. Biological Weathering: </b>Disintegration of rocks by living organisms — roots, lichens, burrowing animals, etc.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>2. Erosion</b></p>
      <p>Erosion is the detachment, removal, and transportation of weathered materials from one place to another by agents of erosion such as running water, wind, glaciers, and waves.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>3. Transportation:</b></p>
      <p> After erosion, the loosened materials are carried or transported by the same agents (water, wind, ice, waves). The distance and speed of transportation depend on:</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>4. Deposition:</b></p>
      <p> When the transporting agent loses energy, it drops the materials it carries.
        Deposition contributes to building up new landforms such as deltas, sand dunes, beaches, moraines, and alluvial plains.</p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Agents of Denudation and Their Actions:</b></p>
      <p> Denudation is carried out by various natural agents, each shaping the landscape differently. The key agents include</p>    
     
      <br>
      <p><b>1. Running Water (River Action):</b> Rivers are the most powerful and widespread agents of denudation.</p>

      <p><b>Processes Involved</b></p>
      <p><b>Erosion:</b>Hydraulic action, abrasion, attrition, and solution.</p>
      <p><b>Transportation:</b>Load carried as solution, suspension, and bed load.</p>       
      <p><b>Deposition:</b>Occurs when river velocity decreases.</p>
    
      <br>
      <p><b>2. Wind (Aeolian Action):</b>Wind acts mainly in arid and semi-arid regions with little vegetation.</p>
      <p><b>Processes Involved</b></p>
      <p><b>Deflation: </b>Lifting and removal of loose particles.</p>
      <p><b>Abrasion: </b>Sand-blasting effect that polishes rock surfaces.</p>
      <p><b>Attrition:</b> Particles collide and break into smaller pieces.</p>
      
      <br>
      <p><b>3. Glaciers (Ice Action)</b> Glaciers are moving masses of ice that erode, transport, and deposit materials in cold regions.</p>
      <p><b>Processes Involved</b></p>
      <p><b>Plucking: </b>Ice freezes onto rocks and pulls them away.</p>
      <p><b>Abrasion: </b>Rock debris embedded in ice grinds the bedrock.</p>
      <p><b>Attrition:</b> Particles collide and break into smaller pieces.</p>

      <br>
      <p><b>4. Waves (Marine Action)</b>Waves and ocean currents shape coastal landscapes through erosion, transportation, and deposition.</p>
      <p><b>Processes Involved</b></p>
      <p><b>Erosion: </b>Hydraulic action, abrasion, corrosion.</p>
      <p><b>Transportation: </b>Longshore drift.</p>
      <p><b>Deposition: </b>Occurs when wave energy is reduced.</p>
